## Project Overview
The demand prediction model aims to forecast the number of bike rentals at different times and locations in NYC. Accurate predictions can help in planning and resource allocation, ensuring that bikes are available where and when they are needed.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the NYC Citi Bike program, which provides data on bike trips including start and end times, locations, and trip durations. Additionally, weather data has been integrated to enhance the predictive power of the model.
